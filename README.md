# Age-Detection-using-Face-Images

## Here is a brief introduction to the project.
The project implemented EDA and age detection through machine learning and deep learning methods on face images.

The source dataset comes from UTKFace and contains over 23700 images across from age 1 to 116 with distinct races and genders. Then the images were splited into relatively balanced 7 age groups, trained and tested on 3 models: XGBoost (traditional machine learning), CNN (deep learning) and VGGFace (transfer learning). CNN finally performed best with test accuracy of 0.49. After redo the age group split, the accuracy increased to 0.6.
